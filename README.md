Cordova iCloud Plugin
========================

iOS iCloud KeyValue Store plugin for PhoneGap

Allows storing small amounts of configuration data in iCloud from Cordova/PhoneGap. Wraps NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore class.

## Compatibility

Cordova/PhoneGap >= 3.0

## Adding the plugin to your project ##

```
cordova plugin add de.martinreinhardt.cordova.plugins.icloud
```

## Using the plugin ##
Import iCloudKV.js

```HTML
<script src="icloud.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

The plugin creates the object `cordova.plugins.icloud` with the following methods:

    sync(successCallback/*(dictionary_with_all_sync_keys)*/ , failCallback) 
       In addition to calling NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore sync method the plugin's sync returns the dictionary holding all iCloud data for the app.
       Normally you only need to call the sync once - on application load. 
       Reminder: Calling sync does not guarantee (or matter for) syncrhonization with iCloud but only between the in-memory and the flash storage that will be eventually synced with iCloud by an independent agent.

    save(key, value, successCallback) 
       Saves string value for the key.
        
    load(key, successCallback/*(value)*/, failCallback) 
       Loads string value for the key.

    remove(key, successCallback) 
        Removes the key. 

    monitor(notificationCallback/*(value)*/, successCallback) 
        Monitor changes of the app's iCloud.

For the simplest (but probably sufficient for most apps) implementation you will only need two methods: sync (on page load) and save (each time a value is changed).
